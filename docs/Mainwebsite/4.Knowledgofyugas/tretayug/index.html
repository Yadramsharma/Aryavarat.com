    <section class="content-section">
      <h3>🕉 Chapter 1: Definition, Duration, and Key Features of Tretā Yuga</h3>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.1 <strong>Meaning and Linguistic Origin of "Tretā"</strong><br>
        Derived from Sanskrit “Tretā” meaning threefold – represents the third part of the Chaturyuga.<br>
        Connected to the number 3, indicating that three pillars of Dharma (Truth, Compassion, Sacrifice) out of four
        remain strong.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.2 <strong>Duration and Time Frame</strong><br>
        4,32,000 human years in one Tretā Yuga (1,296,000 total divine years in a Mahayuga).<br>
        Divided into:<br>
        Krita Sandhya (Dawn) – 1,44,000 years<br>
        Tretā proper – 3,60,000 years<br>
        Tretā Sandhyansha (Dusk) – 28,800 years
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.3 <strong>Cosmic Timeline</strong><br>
        The second Yuga after Satya Yuga, followed by Dvāpara and Kali.<br>
        During this age, Dharma declined by 25% from the perfect balance in Satya Yuga.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.4 <strong>Traits of Tretā Yuga Society</strong><br>
        Rise of ritualistic Yajñas (sacrifices).<br>
        Introduction of caste-based karma—Brahmins (knowledge), Kshatriyas (power), Vaishyas (wealth), Shudras
        (service).<br>
        People are spiritual, but ego and pride begin to rise.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.5 <strong>Human Life and Abilities</strong><br>
        Average lifespan: 10,000 years.<br>
        People had spiritual vision, telepathic communication, and extreme austerity power (tapasya).<br>
        Yogis and Rishis lived in forests, performed long penances to see gods or attain siddhis.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.6 <strong>Natural Environment</strong><br>
        Nature was benevolent – abundant rains, no diseases, animals were tame.<br>
        Forests were filled with rishis, hermitages, sacred rivers.<br>
        The land was called Aryavarta, and Bharatvarsha had golden cities like Mithila, Ayodhya, Kishkindha.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.7 <strong>Key Themes of the Age</strong><br>
        Yajña (Sacrifice): Dominant way of worshipping deities.<br>
        Obedience to Dharma: Kings ruled by Rajarshi standards.<br>
        Rise of Avatars: Bhagavan Vishnu incarnated in major forms to restore balance.<br>
        Formation of Holy Texts: First layers of Vedic codification and rituals by sages like Vashishtha, Vishwamitra,
        and Bharadwaja.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.8 <strong>Major Dynasties and Regions</strong><br>
        Ikshvaku Dynasty ruled Ayodhya – Shri Ram belonged to this.<br>
        Janaka Dynasty of Mithila – known for wisdom and dharma.<br>
        Vanara Kingdoms like Kishkindha under Sugriva and Vali.<br>
        Rakshasa Kingdoms: Lanka under Ravana.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.9 <strong>Decline of Dharma Toward the End</strong><br>
        Desire, pride, war, jealousy started increasing.<br>
        Misuse of Vedic rituals (like Ravana doing tapasya for selfish ends).<br>
        Rise of Adharmic rulers led to the need for Avatars.
      </div>

      <div class="chapter-point">🔹 1.10 <strong>Symbolism in Scriptures</strong><br>
        Tretā Yuga represents divine intervention in a world slowly losing innocence.<br>
        Transition from Satya’s truth to Tretā’s duty.<br>
        Shows the cost of spiritual negligence and power misuse.

      <section>
        <h3> Chapter 4.0: Ramayan – A Superficial Narrative of Divine Events</h3>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Bala Kanda – Divine Childhood and Destiny Begins</strong>
          <p>In the divine land of Ayodhya, King Dasharatha ruled with righteousness. Yet he was childless, so he
            conducted the grand Ashvamedha and Putrakameshti Yajñas under the guidance of sage Rishyasringa. From the
            yajñic fire emerged divine nectar, which he distributed to his queens: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra.
            Soon, four divine sons were born: Rāma, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna.</p>
          <p>Rāma, the eldest and an incarnation of Vishnu, displayed extraordinary virtue, wisdom, and strength even as
            a child. He was deeply bonded with Lakshmana, while Bharata and Shatrughna shared another divine friendship.
            Sage Vishwāmitra took young Rāma and Lakshmana to protect his yajña from rākṣasas (demons), initiating them
            into spiritual and martial knowledge. They slayed Tāṭakā and Mārīcha.</p>
          <p>As their destiny unfolded, they arrived at Mithila, where King Janaka organized a Swayamvara. Princess
            Sītā, an incarnation of Lakṣmī, was to wed the one who could lift and string Shiva's celestial bow. Rāma
            effortlessly broke the bow, winning Sītā's hand. The wedding was celebrated with great joy, and the brothers
            were married to Janaka's daughters, aligning cosmic unions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Ayodhya Kanda – Exile and Duty</strong>
          <p>As Dasharatha prepared to crown Rāma as king, Queen Kaikeyī invoked her two boons to exile Rāma for 14
            years and crown Bharata instead. Though grief-stricken, Rāma accepted with calm grace. Sītā and Lakshmana
            chose to accompany him. Dasharatha died heartbroken, and Bharata, refusing kingship, placed Rāma's sandals
            on the throne and vowed to rule as regent.</p>
          <p>Rāma, Sītā, and Lakshmana settled in Chitrakoot, living a simple hermit's life. Their presence in the
            forests marked the start of divine interactions with sages and tribals. The trio became spiritual exemplars
            of sacrifice, duty, and renunciation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Aranya Kanda – Forest Challenges and Abduction</strong>
          <p>The trio ventured deep into the Dandakaranya forest, aiding rishis and defeating rākṣasas like Khara and
            Dūṣaṇa. Shūrpaṇakhā, Rāvaṇa's sister, proposed to Rāma and was humiliated. She incited Rāvaṇa, who sought
            revenge. With the aid of Mārīcha, Rāvaṇa tricked Rāma and abducted Sītā to Laṇkā while Lakshmana was away.
          </p>
          <p>The golden deer incident and Sītā's firm adherence to dharma despite fear showcase her divine nature.
            Jatāyu, the noble vulture, died trying to save her. Rāma and Lakshmana wept and searched for Sītā, beginning
            their quest of cosmic justice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Kishkindha Kanda – Alliance with the Vanaras</strong>
          <p>Rāma allied with Sugrīva, a vanara exiled by his brother Vāli. Rāma slew Vāli, restoring Sugrīva as king of
            Kiṣkindhā. Hanumān, the mighty devotee of Rāma, emerged as a central hero. The Vanara sena (monkey army)
            began their southern search for Sītā. Hanumān leapt over the ocean, reaching Laṇkā.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Sundara Kanda – Hanuman’s Devotion and Heroism</strong>
          <p>Hanumān met Sītā in Ashoka Vatika, offered Rāma's ring, and consoled her. He burned Laṇkā after being
            captured and returned with news. His heroism represents Bhakti Yoga—devotion in action. Sītā's chastity,
            courage, and commitment during captivity exemplify the power of divine femininity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Yuddha Kanda – The Great War</strong>
          <p>Rāma built Setubandha (Rāma Setu) across the ocean with floating stones marked "राम". A colossal battle
            ensued in Laṇkā. Rāma defeated Rāvaṇa after intense combat. Vibhiṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa's righteous brother, was
            crowned king. Sītā underwent Agni Parīṣā (trial by fire) to prove her purity. Agni Dev returned her
            unscathed, revealing her divinity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter-point">
          <strong>✦ Uttara and Luv-Kusha Kanda – Ram Rājya and Legacy</strong>
          <p>Returning to Ayodhyā, Rāma was crowned and established Rāma Rājya—a rule of dharma, prosperity, and
            equality. Doubts among citizens led Rāma to send pregnant Sītā to the forest, where she gave birth to Lava
            and Kusha in Vālmīki's ashram. They grew as valiant princes and recited the Rāmāyaṇa in Ayodhyā.</p>
          <p>Sītā, unwilling to return to a world that doubted her, returned to Bhūdevī (Mother Earth). Rāma eventually
            ended his avatāra by entering Sarayū River, returning to Vaikuṣṭha. The story of Rāma became immortal,
            symbolizing Dharma's supremacy, the strength of truth, and the divinity of relationships.</p>

      <div class="chapter-point">
        <strong>🔹 5.1 Qualities of Shri Ram and How Modern Boys Can Follow</strong>
        <p>
          Shri Ram, the Maryada Purushottam (Ideal Man), is the embodiment of dharma, truth, responsibility, humility,
          and self-control. For modern boys, emulating his values means becoming ideal sons, students, brothers,
          husbands, leaders, and citizens.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Shloka:</strong></p>
        <p class="shloka">
          रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः सदा सत्यपराक्रमः ।<br>
          राजा सर्वस्य लोकस्य देवकल्पो यथा हरिः ॥
        </p>
        <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "Rama is the embodiment of Dharma, always truthful and courageous, the king of
          the entire world, akin to the gods like Vishnu."
        </p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Shri Ram is seen as the living form of righteousness. He upheld truth even in
          difficult times, which is a lesson in moral clarity and courage for today’s youth.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truthfulness:</strong> Ram never lied or twisted facts. Boys should uphold truth in academics,
            relationships, and duties.</li>
          <li><strong>Respectful Speech:</strong> Ram never used harsh words. Today’s youth should speak with compassion
            and discipline.</li>
          <li><strong>Control Over Anger:</strong> Ram remained calm even in provocation. Modern boys must learn anger
            management and equanimity.</li>
          <li><strong>Obedience to Elders:</strong> Ram accepted exile without argument. Today’s boys should understand
            the value of respecting parents and teachers.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Ram led armies, protected sages, and ruled kingdoms. Youth should handle
            responsibilities, from home chores to career goals.</li>

      <div class="chapter-point">
        <strong>🔹 5.2 Values of Sita and How Modern Girls Can Follow</strong>

          Sita is the epitome of strength, purity, devotion, intelligence, and grace. She is not only a symbol of ideal
          womanhood but also a resilient and wise individual. For modern girls, Sita offers a timeless model of dignity,
          courage, and faith.

          अनुगता वनं सीता रामस्य प्रियकामिनी ॥
        </p>
        <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "Sita, the beloved of Ram, gave up luxuries, kingdoms, and even adornments to
          follow him to the forest."
        </p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Sita teaches us that love and duty are above material comfort. Her commitment shows

          </li>

            traditional and modern knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Graceful Demeanor:</strong> Sita was polite, calm, and respectful. Girls today should balance
            assertiveness with humility.</li>

            must aspire to build mutual respect in relationships.</li>
