        <p>
        <div class=sanskrit-bold>🕉️ Chapter 1: What is Satyayug?</div>
        <br>

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.1 Meaning of the Word “Satya Yuga”</div>
        The word Satya Yuga is derived from two Sanskrit words:
        <br>
        Satya (सत्य) = Truth, purity, absolute reality
        <br>
        Yuga (युग) = Age or epoch
        <br>
        Together, Satya Yuga means “The Age of Truth.”
        <br>
        In this Yuga, truth (Satya) reigns supreme. Dharma (cosmic law or righteousness) stands firmly on all four
        legs — Satya (truth), Daya (compassion), Tapasya (austerity), and Dana (charity). Every being follows the
        path of divine righteousness, and there is no evil, falsehood, corruption, or immorality.
        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.2 Position in the Yuga Cycle (Chaturyuga)</div>
        According to Hindu cosmology, time is cyclical, not linear. One complete cycle of four ages is called a
        Chaturyuga, comprising:

                            <td>50% (2 legs)</td>

        </div>


        Thus, Satya Yuga is the longest and purest Yuga in each cycle, where divine knowledge is intuitive and all
        beings are spiritually evolved.

        One Mahayuga = 4,320,000 years, and 1 Kalpa = 1,000 Mahayugas = 4.32 billion years, which equals 1 day of
        Brahma, the Creator.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.4 Life in Satya Yuga</div>

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.8 Symbolism of Satya Yuga</div>
        Satyayug is not just a historical or cosmic event, but a state of consciousness:

        When a person lives in truth, compassion, and purity, they live in Satya Yuga mentally.

        In Yogic philosophy, the Ajna (third eye) and Sahasrara chakra activation leads to Satya Yuga-like awareness.
        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.9 Purpose of Satya Yuga</div>
        To establish Dharma on Earth in its purest form.

        To lay the foundation of cosmic balance for all future ages.

        To remind souls of their divine origin and purpose.
        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🔶 1.10 Ending of Satya Yuga</div>
        Though extremely long (17+ lakh years), the age gradually ends when:

        Ego and duality begin to arise.

        The Dharma bull loses one leg, entering Treta Yuga.

        First signs of desire, ownership, and inequality emerge.

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">📖 Chapter 2: The Four Legs of Dharma in Satya Yuga</div>
        <br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🕉️ 2.1 What is Dharma?</div>

        Dharma (धर्म) is a key concept in Sanatan Dharma. It refers to:
        <br>
        • Cosmic law and order
        <br>
        • Moral duties
        <br>
        • Right conduct
        <br>
        • Righteousness
        <br><br>
        In the Puranas, Dharma is symbolized as a bull (धर्मराज वृषभ), and in each Yuga, it loses one leg:
        <br>
        • Satya Yuga: 4 legs (100%)
        <br>
        •Treta Yuga: 3 legs (75%)
        <br>
        •Dvapara Yuga: 2 legs (50%)
        <br>
        •Kali Yuga: 1 leg (25%)
        <br>
        Thus, in Satya Yuga, Dharma stands completely, and society is perfectly aligned with truth, compassion,
        austerity, and charity.

        In Satya Yuga, most beings were divine or semi-divine. But whenever the cosmic balance needed guidance
        or protection, the Supreme manifested as avatars (incarnations).
        The purpose of these divine appearances was not to destroy evil (as there was almost none), but to teach
        higher knowledge, guide evolution, and prepare the world for coming Yugas.

        While Satyavrata was offering water in the river, a tiny fish begged for protection.
        <br>
        He kept it in a pot → tank → pond → sea, but it kept growing.
        <br>
        Realizing it was Lord Vishnu, Satyavrata bowed.
        Matsya warned: “A pralaya (cosmic flood) is coming. Build a boat and collect seeds, sages, animals, and
        Vedas.”
        <br>
        During the flood, Matsya guided the boat using a Serpent (Vasuki) as a rope.
        <br>
        Matsya killed Hayagriva, who had stolen the Vedas, and restored them to Brahma.
        <br>
        After the flood, life began again. Satyavrata became Vaivasvata Manu, the father of mankind.

            <h2>1. What is a Prajapati?</h2>
            <p><strong>Prajapati</strong> is a Sanskrit term formed by two words: <em>Praja mean creation/offspring
                </em> and <em>Pati means lord/master</em> Thus, a Prajapati is the <strong>"Lord of Creation"</strong>
                or <strong>"Progenitor of Beings"</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the Vedas and Puranas, a Prajapati is one who helps create and maintain the world either physically,
                mentally, or spiritually. They are appointed by Brahma or emerge through divine means to continue cosmic
                balance and life propagation.</p>

                    Devas like Indra,Surya,etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Puranas & Smritis:</strong> Brahma creates Prajapatis as mind-born sons (Manasaputras) to
                    help in creation and guide the world spiritually and physically.</li>

        Even though Satya Yuga was free from tamas (darkness) and rajas (desire), Divine forms still incarnated,
        not to correct humanity, but to deepen the dharma, transmit secret knowledge, and lay the foundation for
        spiritual systems that would help in later Yugas.

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🏡 4.1 Society in Satya Yuga</div>
        Satya Yuga society was completely egalitarian, non-materialistic, and spiritually evolved. The entire
        world was like a hermitage, where people meditated, served each other, and experienced the Divine
        constantly.
        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-italic">🌸 Key Features:</div>
        • No government, kings, or police — all people were self-governed through Dharma.
        <br>
        • No need for temples — God resided in every heart clearly.
        <br>
        • No agriculture — Earth gave food naturally, trees bore fruits throughout the year.
        <br>

        • No cities or villages — people lived in ashrams or natural sanctuaries.
        <br>

        • No caste, gender, or social divisions — all were seen as Atman (soul).

        In Satya Yuga, Earth was not seen as a planet of resources — she was Bhumi Devi, a conscious goddess:

        People called her Vasudha, Dharani, Prithvi Mata, or simply Ma.

        She responded to thoughts, vibrations, and prayers.

        Humans would lie down, touch her, and hear her breath — yes, Earth was alive, breathing, and radiating
        love.

        “The Earth was so spiritually charged that walking barefoot on her gave you divine bliss.”

        Space Akasha Sound, spiritual vibration

        Each element was so balanced that:

        No pollution, no imbalance, no disease ever occurred.

        Air carried natural Om sounds, water healed instantly, fire never harmed.

        Even a flame would never burn a saint or animal by mistake — such was its awareness.

        Balanced seasons, each merging gently into the next.

        No floods, no droughts, no extreme heat or cold.

        Rain came exactly when needed, often as a blessing from the Devas.

        In Satya Yuga:

        Trees bore flowers and fruits all year.

        Some trees were Kalpavrikshas — if you simply thought of a fruit, it would manifest.

        No farming or irrigation needed — plants grew out of pure spiritual desire.

        "Fruits would fall when you felt hunger; leaves would glow when you sought shade."

        Trees could communicate with humans, and forests were seen as universities of nature.

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🐘 5.5 Animals and Birds – Harmony in the Wild</div>
        Lions, tigers, deer, snakes, peacocks, and elephants all lived together with humans.

        No killing, no food chains — all creatures were vegetarian.

        Birds would sing mantras. Even insects lived without fear.
        <br>
        <div class="sanskrit-italic">🦢 Examples:</div>

        People could meditate on Meru (North Pole) and hear the sound of the universe.

        Mountains like Kailash, Mandara, and Meru were energy pillars (axis mundi).

        Sacred rivers like Ganga, Saraswati, and Yamuna flowed with divine energy.

        Water from the Ganga was said to:

        Heal diseases instantly

        Open the third eye

        Birds and leaves would vibrate in harmony with wind’s rhythm.

        Meditation became easier because the environment supported inner silence.

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🧘‍♀️ 5.9 Sacred Geography</div>
        The whole Earth was considered sacred land. But some areas were supercharged:

        Mount Meru was the central energy spine of the Earth

        Ocean depths carried conscious whales and sages

        Each forest, river, and mountain had its own soul (devata) and name.

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🍃 6.4 Signs of Decline in Nature and Society</div>
        Sign What Changed<br>
        • Meditation Not spontaneous anymore — people needed rituals to focus.<br>
        • Food Earth slowly stopped giving ready-to-eat fruits in all places.<br>
        • Speech Some began to speak for attention, not truth.<br>
        • Ownership “This is my land, my tree” appeared in some minds.<br>
        • Violence Tiny signs of harm — plucking flowers without permission, scaring animals.<br>
        • Weather Seasons began shifting — storms and droughts started appearing slowly.<br>

        The change was not sudden. It took thousands of years. But the seed of separation had been planted.
        <br><br>
        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🧠 6.5 The Beginning of Rituals (Karma Kanda)</div>
        Since Tapasya faded, humans could no longer easily access the Divine through silence alone. So:<br>

        • Yajnas (fire sacrifices) were introduced to reconnect with gods.<br>

        • Mantras were now spoken out loud, not just in the heart.<br>

        • Priesthood emerged — guiding others through rituals.<br>

        • Dharma became externalized through Shastras and codes.<br>

        <!--This is the foundation of Treta Yuga society, where:

                Inner spirituality becomes outer rituals and duties.--><br>

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">🛡️ 6.6 Rise of Kings and Rulers</div>
        In Satya Yuga, everyone was self-governed. But in the Treta transition:

        • Some became stronger or more powerful<br>

        • People began looking to leaders for justice<br>

        • First kings like Ikshvaku, Vivasvan, and others emerged<br>

        • Dandaneeti (rules, justice, punishment) was born<br><br>

        <!--This marks the end of spiritual anarchy and the start of structured society.-->

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">⚖️ 6.7 Dharma Now Stands on Three Legs</div>
        By the time Treta Yuga fully begins:<br>

        • Satya (truth) still exists<br>

        • Daya (compassion) still flows<br>

        • Dana (charity) is still practiced<br>

        • Tapasya (austerity) becomes rare<br><br>

        <!--So, Dharma now walks on 3 legs, not 4.-->

        <div class="sanskrit-bold">⚔️ 6.8 The Cosmic Preparation for Rama Avatar</div>
        The decline of Satya Yuga sets the stage for:

        • The birth of Rakshasas (demons)<br>

        • The rise of Adharma (unrighteousness)<br>

        • The divine decision that shree Vishnu will take form as shree Parshurama and shree Rama in Treta Yuga<br>
