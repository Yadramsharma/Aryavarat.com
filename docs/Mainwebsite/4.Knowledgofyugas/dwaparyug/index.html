    <hr class="title-underline" />

    <main class="chapter-body">

        <h2>📖 Chapter 1: Introduction to Dwapar Yuga</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>🔱 Dwapar Yuga (Sanskrit: द्वापर युग):</strong><br>Dwapar Yuga is the third age in the cycle of the
            four Yugas — Satya, Treta,
            Dwapar, and Kali. It marks a crucial transitional phase where divine perfection begins to erode, giving rise
            to moral and spiritual decline. The term “Dwapar” signifies “two parts,” reflecting the fact that only 50%
            of Dharma remains during this age.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>📅 Time Span of Dwapar Yuga:</strong><br> As per the Puranas, this Yuga lasts for 864,000 human
            years, which includes a
            72,000-year transition (Sandhya and Sandhyansha). The remaining 792,000 years mark the core duration of the
            Dwapar Yuga. Compared to the earlier ages — Satya Yuga with 100% Dharma, Treta Yuga with 75%, Dwapar holds
            50%, and will be followed by Kali Yuga with just 25%.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🌍 World Condition in Dwapar Yuga</strong><br> The world witnessed a gradual erosion of spiritual
            values. Rituals were still performed, but their inner
            meaning was fading. Kings and sages became more ambitious and argumentative. Wars erupted frequently —
            especially dynastic and regional rivalries. The emergence of duality and reasoning over intuition became
            dominant features.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🧬 Human Evolution in Dwapar Yuga :</strong><br> Human minds grew sharper, more strategic, but also
            unstable. Physical strength remained superior to
            modern humans, with average lifespans nearing 1,000 years. However, humility, devotion, and tapasya
            declined. The era witnessed a rise in sects and ritualism over true wisdom.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>👑 Political Structure:</strong><br> Politically, the Yuga saw the emergence of strong empires such
            as the Kurus of Hastinapur, the Yadavas of
            Mathura and Dwarka, and the kingdoms of Magadha, Panchala, and Anga. Governance was predominantly monarchic,
            guided by Raj Dharma. Sages, councils, and ministers played advisory roles.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🧘‍♂️ Philosophical Thought:</strong><br> Philosophical traditions began to split. The Upanishadic
            essence was overshadowed by yajnas and
            Shrauta rituals. The Karma Kanda dominated the Jnana Kanda. It was during this time that Lord Krishna spoke
            the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, reawakening the dormant path of selfless duty, wisdom, and devotion.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🌌Divine Incarnations:</strong><br> Dwapar Yuga stands out for its divine incarnations. Lord Krishna
            descended as the Paripoorna Avatar of
            Vishnu. Balarama accompanied him as Adi Shesha. Ved Vyasa, the literary incarnation of Vishnu, compiled and
            arranged the Vedas and composed the Mahabharata. Parashurama also continued his presence from the previous
            Yuga.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>📖Scriptural Highlights</strong><br> Among scriptures, the Mahabharata remains the crown jewel of
            this age, containing over 100,000 shlokas,
            including the Gita. The Bhagavata Purana elaborates on Krishna’s divine play (Leela). The Harivamsa Purana
            extends the Mahabharata’s narrative and focuses on Krishna’s life in Dwarka.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🏛️Key Symbols</strong><br> Dwapar Yuga is symbolized by several emblems:

                <th>Symbol</th>
                <th>Meaning</th>

        </table>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>🌀conclusion of dwapar:</strong><br> The Yuga concluded with the disappearance of Lord Krishna in
            Prabhas Kshetra, the submergence of Dwarka
            into the sea, and the destruction of the Yadava dynasty. With the divine presence withdrawn, Kali Yuga began
            — an age marked by darkness, confusion, and the further fall of Dharma.

        <h2>📖 Chapter 2: Time Span, Calculation & Cosmology of Dwapar Yuga</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>🧭 Yuga Measurement in Sanatan Dharma:</strong><br>
            Time in Sanatan Dharma is vast and cyclical — based on kalachakra (कालचक्र), the cosmic wheel of time. Yugas
            are
            four great ages that repeat in cycles, governed by cosmic order.</p>

        <p><strong>🔹 The Four Yugas:</strong><br>
            Yuga Divine Years Human Years Dharma Remaining<br>
            Satya (Krita) Yuga 4,800 1,728,000 100%<br>
            Treta Yuga 3,600 1,296,000 75%<br>
            Dwapar Yuga 2,400 864,000 50%<br>
            Kali Yuga 1,200 432,000 25%<br>
            1 divine year = 360 human years.</p>

        <p>📌 Total duration of a Chaturyuga (Maha Yuga) =<br>
            4,800 + 3,600 + 2,400 + 1,200 = 12,000 divine years = 4,320,000 human years</p>

        <p><strong>🌌 Dwapar Yuga Time Calculation:</strong><br>
            🔸 Duration of Dwapar Yuga:<br>
            Core Yuga (main span): 2,000 divine years = 720,000 human years<br>
            Sandhya (dawn): 100 divine years = 36,000 human years<br>
            Sandhyansha (dusk): 100 divine years = 36,000 human years</p>

        <p>🔸 Total Duration =<br>
            Core + Sandhya + Sandhyansha = 864,000 human years</p>

        <p><strong>⏳ When Did Dwapar Yuga Occur?</strong><br>
            Different calendars give different placements, but here's a common traditional calculation:<br>
            Start of Dwapar Yuga: ~3,898,000 years ago (before Kali Yuga began)<br>
            End of Dwapar Yuga / Beginning of Kali Yuga:<br>
            18 February 3102 BCE (according to Hindu tradition)<br>
            Thus, the Mahabharata War occurred around 3139 BCE, and Krishna departed in 3102 BCE, marking the end of
            Dwapar.</p>

        <p><strong>🌠 Cosmology of Dwapar Yuga:</strong><br>
            🔮 Cosmic Hierarchy:<br>
            Level Description<br>
            Brahmaloka Abode of Brahma<br>
            Vaikuntha Abode of Vishnu<br>
            Kailasha Abode of Shiva<br>
            Svarga (Heaven) Realm of Devas<br>
            Bhurloka Earth plane (humans)<br>
            Patala Netherworld (Asuras, Nagas)<br>
            Dwapar Yuga spans multiple realms simultaneously. While humanity suffers degradation, divine interventions
            increase
            (Krishna, Vyasa, Balarama).</p>

        <p><strong>🛕 Celestial Markers of Dwapar:</strong><br>
            📜 Astronomical Events:<br>
            Ancient texts such as Surya Siddhanta, Mahabharata, and Jyotisha Shastra record planetary positions and
            eclipses
            during Mahabharata and Krishna’s time.<br>
            Key celestial signs:<br>
            Solar and Lunar eclipses occurring within 13 days (just before Kurukshetra war)<br>
            Position of Saturn in Rohini nakshatra<br>
            Krishna’s birth under Rohini nakshatra<br>
            These events are used by scholars to approximate historical dates of Dwapar events.</p>

        <p><strong>🧿 The Decline of Dharma and Time's Role:</strong><br>
            Dharma declines in each Yuga as time passes.<br>
            In Dwapar Yuga:<br>
            Dharma stands on only two legs, represented by the bull of Dharma in the Bhagavata Purana.<br>
            The other two legs (truth and austerity) are gone.<br>
            Even good people like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna are morally confused, representing a time of ethical
            ambiguity.</p>

        <p><strong>🪐 Kalpa, Manvantara & Dwapar :</strong><br>
            To understand the cosmic setting of Dwapar Yuga, we must place it in the larger cycle of time.<br>
            📘 Definitions:<br>
            Kalpa = 1 day of Brahma = 4.32 billion years<br>
            Manvantara = 1/14th of Kalpa = 306.72 million years<br>
            Maha Yuga = 4.32 million years<br>
            We are in:<br>
            Current Kalpa: Shveta Varaha Kalpa<br>
            Current Manvantara: 7th – Vaivasvata Manu<br>
            Current Maha Yuga: 28th of this Manvantara<br>
            Current Yuga: Kali Yuga (preceded by Dwapar)<br>
            So, Dwapar Yuga occurred in the 28th Mahayuga of the 7th Manvantara.</p>

        <p><strong>🧱 Measurement of Time in Dwapar :</strong><br>
            Sanatan texts break down time as follows:<br>
            Unit Meaning Duration<br>
            Paramanu Smallest particle of time ~0.0002 seconds<br>
            Nimesha Blink of an eye ~0.213 seconds<br>
            Muhurta 48 minutes 1/30th of a day<br>
            Paksha Fortnight (half lunar month) 15 days<br>
            Maas Month 30 days<br>
            Ritu Season 2 months<br>
            Ayana Solstice (Uttarayan/Dakshinayan) 6 months<br>
            Varsha Year 12 months<br>
            Even in Dwapar, time was sacred. Rituals, wars, and festivals were conducted according to lunar and solar
            calendars.
        </p>

        <p><strong>🔱 Vyasa and the Division of Time:</strong><br>
            Ved Vyasa’s Contributions:<br>
            Ved Vyasa (incarnation of Vishnu) divided the Vedas into four parts (Rig, Sama, Yajur, Atharva) to make them
            understandable.<br>
            He created the Puranas to explain Dharma in simple stories.<br>
            Compiled the Mahabharata to explain complex Yuga Dharma and time’s impact on humans.<br>
            Introduced Bhakti movement as a solution to degradation in Dwapar and Kali.<br>
            Thus, Vyasa acted as the spiritual timekeeper of Dwapar Yuga.</p>

        <p><strong>🕊️ The Closing of Dwapar Yuga :</strong><br>
            Key events leading to the end of Dwapar:<br>
            Kurukshetra war: Massive destruction of Kshatriyas.<br>
            Krishna’s departure: After he is shot by Jara (hunter) in Prabhas.<br>
            Submergence of Dwarka: Krishna’s city vanishes into the sea.<br>
            Yadava destruction: Entire clan perishes in drunken infighting.<br>
            After Krishna leaves:<br>
            "As soon as Krishna left the Earth, Dharma too ascended to the heavens and Kali descended." — Bhagavata
            Purana</p>

        <p><strong>🕰️ Why Time Became Accelerated :</strong><br>
            In Dwapar, time seems faster, and people age quicker than in Satya and Treta. This is because:<br>
            Karma becomes more instant in its results.<br>
            The mind becomes restless, shortening perception of time.<br>
            Rituals increase in number but lose depth, leading to a busier lifestyle.<br>
            Thus, spiritual time slows down, but material time accelerates.</p>

        <h2>📖 Chapter 3: Yuga Dharma and the Decline of Righteousness in Dwapar Yuga</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>🕉️ What is Dharma in Dwapar Yuga?:</strong><br>
            In Sanatan Dharma, Dharma is the eternal law of righteousness, cosmic order, and moral duty. Each Yuga
            witnesses a different strength of Dharma.<br>
            In Dwapar Yuga, Dharma stands on two legs (as per Puranic allegory) — only 50% of righteousness survives.
            Truth and purity are eroded, while rituals and intellectualism dominate.<br>
            “धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः” – Dharma protects those who protect it.<br>
            But in Dwapar, this becomes harder — even Dharmic men like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna become trapped in
            ethical dilemmas.</p>

        <p><strong>📉 How Dharma Declines in Dwapar Yuga:</strong><br>
            Aspect Satya Yuga Treta Yuga Dwapar Yuga Kali Yuga<br>
            Dharma Standing 4 legs 3 legs 2 legs 1 leg<br>
            Truth Absolute Strong Relative Minimal<br>
            Ego & Power Absent Contained Emerging Dominant<br>
            Devotion (Bhakti) Deep Sattvic Conflicted Struggling<br>
            Morality Clear Noble Complex Confused<br>
            Dharma declines due to:<br>
            Rise in material desires<br>
            Use of diplomacy over truth<br>
            Misuse of rituals without inner purity<br>
            Decline of Guru–Shishya tradition<br>
            Increasing importance of caste over karma</p>

        <p><strong>🧠 Intellectualism vs Realization:</strong><br>
            In Dwapar, people shift from direct spiritual realization (through meditation or tapas) to:<br>
            Scholarly debates<br>
            Blind ritualism<br>
            Scripture quoting without understanding<br>
            For example:<br>
            People begin arguing about Dharma rather than living it.<br>
            Kings seek victory and fame more than justice.<br>
            This creates the era of “Half-Truths”, where what is legal may not be just.</p>

        <p><strong>⚖️ Moral Confusion in Mahabharata:</strong><br>
            The Mahabharata is the spiritual mirror of Dwapar Yuga’s Dharma crisis.<br>
            🧍 Key characters caught in Dharma conflicts:<br>
            Bhishma: Sworn to serve Hastinapur, but ends up serving adharmic Duryodhana.<br>
            Drona: Knows Dharma, yet fights for the Kauravas out of loyalty to throne.<br>
            Karna: Loyal to Duryodhana due to gratitude, despite knowing he’s wrong.<br>
            Yudhishthira: Speaks half-truth (Ashwatthama is dead) to win a war.<br>
            👉 These show how Dharma becomes complex, needing divine intervention like Krishna.</p>

        <p><strong>🧞 Rise of Deceit and Duality:</strong><br>
            In Dwapar:<br>
            Lies, manipulation, and tactics like spy networks, poisonings, dice games become common.<br>
            Dharma declines into politics and strategy.<br>
            Examples:<br>
            Shakuni uses dice game to deceive Pandavas.<br>
            Jayadratha, Drona, and Karna all use tricks in battle.<br>
            Kauravas plot trap marriages, exile, and assassination.<br>
            Hence, Dwapar is the era of “masking adharma in Dharma’s name.”</p>

        <p><strong>🛕 Ritualism and Show:</strong><br>
            In previous Yugas, rituals were done with inner purity. In Dwapar:<br>
            Yajnas are performed mechanically for name, fame, and fruit (phala).<br>
            Brahmins gain pride in scriptural knowledge, but lack experience of truth.<br>
            Caste system hardens, becoming rigid.<br>
            Even sages like Durvasa and Parashurama exhibit anger, pride, and ego, showing a fall from sattva to rajas.
        </p>

        <p><strong>🛡️ Dharma of Kingship Fails</strong><br>
            In Dwapar, Rajdharma (Duty of Kings) starts to decline.<br>
            Bad kings emerge:<br>
            Duryodhana: Greedy for power, disrespects elders.<br>
            Shishupala: Blasphemes Krishna openly.<br>
            Kamsa: Kills his sister’s children for survival.<br>
            Jarasandha: Expands empire with cruelty.<br>
            Even good kings struggle to uphold Dharma in a corrupt age:<br>
            Drupada, Virata, Dhritarashtra – fail to take moral stands.</p>

        <p><strong>🧘‍♂️ Dharma According to Krishna:</strong><br>
            Lord Krishna appears in Dwapar as Yugavatar – not just to destroy evil but to redefine Dharma for the
            age.<br>
            Key Teachings:<br>
            "Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati Bharata…"<br>
            Whenever Dharma declines, I manifest.<br>
            “Karmanye vadhikaraste…”<br>
            Do your duty without attachment to results.<br>
            “Sarva-dharman parityajya…”<br>
            Leave all conceptions of Dharma, surrender to Me alone.<br>
            Krishna accepts that rigid moral systems don’t work in Dwapar and offers adaptive Dharma (Yuga-appropriate
            path).</p>

        <p><strong>🦚 Rise of Bhakti as New Dharma:</strong><br>
            As Vedic Dharma weakens, Krishna promotes Bhakti (devotion) as the easiest path to liberation in Dwapar:<br>
            Sudama’s love is valued more than riches.<br>
            Gopis' surrender is more sacred than ritual.<br>
            Draupadi’s single cry “Govinda!” brings divine help.<br>
            Thus, love becomes superior to logic, and devotion higher than debate.</p>

        <p><strong>🪔 Final Signs of Dharma’s End:</strong><br>
            In the final phase of Dwapar:<br>
            Yadavas become arrogant, despite being Krishna’s kin.<br>
            Krishna sees corruption even among his own people.<br>
            Dwarka is destroyed, and Krishna withdraws himself from Earth.<br>
            Ashwatthama releases Brahmastra after the war — final misuse of divine weapons.<br>
            Kali Yuga is born as Krishna departs.</p>

        <h2>📖 Chapter 4: Social, Political & Cultural Structure in Dwapar Yuga</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>🏛️ Society in Dwapar Yuga – An Overview:</strong><br>
            The society of Dwapar Yuga was highly structured but began to show signs of inequality and decline. Compared
            to
            Satya and Treta Yugas, Dwapar’s society was:<br>
            More organized yet rigid<br>
            Rich in rituals but poor in purity<br>
            Full of warriors and scholars, but also ego and pride<br>
            Dwapar society saw the emergence of:<br>
            Urban settlements and grand cities (Hastinapur, Mathura, Dwarka)<br>
            Formal politics, alliances, and espionage<br>
            Intellectual debates and scriptural conflicts<br>
            Cultural extravagance but spiritual confusion</p>

        <p><strong>📜 Varna System (Caste Structure):</strong><br>
            Unlike Satya and Treta Yugas, the varna system in Dwapar Yuga began to shift from guna-karma based
            (qualities &
            work) to janma based (by birth).<br>
            🔹 The Four Varnas:<br>
            Varna Role Characteristics in Dwapar<br>
            Brahmins Priests, teachers, scholars Learned but proud, often focused on ritual<br>
            Kshatriyas Warriors, kings, protectors Powerful, politically active, often arrogant<br>
            Vaishyas Merchants, agriculturists, traders Wealthy, rising class, often ignored in power<br>
            Shudras Service providers, laborers Marginalized, but some respected (e.g. Vidura)<br>
            Some notable challenges in Dwapar:<br>
            Caste discrimination begins to emerge<br>
            Merit-based elevation becomes rare<br>
            Conflict between traditional varna roles and real-world actions</p>

        <p><strong>🗡️ Political Landscape:</strong><br>
            Dwapar Yuga had a dynamic and complex political world with many kingdoms.<br>
            🔸 Major Kingdoms:<br>
            Hastinapur – Kuru dynasty (Pandavas and Kauravas)<br>
            Dwarka – Krishna’s kingdom<br>
            Magadha – Jarasandha’s rule<br>
            Panchala – Draupadi’s native land<br>
            Matsya, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kalinga – All active in Mahabharata<br>
            🔸 Features of Politics:<br>
            Use of spies, alliances, marriage diplomacy<br>
            Frequent wars, betrayals, and subtle diplomacy<br>
            Emergence of councils, sabhas, and ministerial roles<br>
            “Politics in Dwapar was not just warfare — it was warfare of minds.”</p>

        <p><strong>👑 Kingship & Rajdharma:</strong><br>
            Kings were expected to uphold Raj Dharma — the king's duty to protect dharma and ensure justice.<br>
            🔹 Qualities of Ideal Kings:<br>
            Wisdom (Viveka)<br>
            Courage (Veerya)<br>
            Justice (Nyaya)<br>
            Humility (Vinaya)<br>
            🔹 Problems in Dwapar:<br>
            Blind loyalty to throne over moral responsibility<br>
            Rise of kings like Duryodhana, who represent adharma<br>
            Dhritarashtra’s blindness symbolic of rulers’ moral blindness<br>
            Even good kings like Yudhishthira are tested again and again — showing how Dharma was hard to hold onto.</p>

        <p><strong>👩 Role of Women</strong><br>
            Women in Dwapar Yuga played powerful yet often tragic roles. They had:<br>
            Knowledge, strength, and devotion<br>
            But were subject to patriarchal control and political manipulation<br>
            Notable Women:<br>
            Draupadi – Symbol of insulted womanhood and Dharma’s test<br>
            Kunti – Wise, strategic, spiritual mother figure<br>
            Gandhari – Symbol of loyalty and inner sorrow<br>
            Subhadra – Sister of Krishna, politically significant marriage<br>
            Rukmini, Satyabhama – Krishna’s queens, each with unique characteristics<br>
            Women were worshipped, but also wronged, reflecting the duality of the age.</p>

        <p><strong>💱 Trade, Economy, and Wealth:</strong><br>
            Dwapar had a flourishing economy:<br>
            Cities like Dwarka, Indraprastha, Varanasi were trade hubs<br>
            Use of gold coins (nishka, suvarna)<br>
            Trade in spices, gems, silks, horses, chariots<br>
            Guilds and merchant organizations (like today’s business chambers)<br>
            However, wealth imbalance and greed also increased:<br>
            Dice games (gambling) reflected moral decay<br>
            Gifts and dowries became political tools</p>

        <p><strong>⚖️ Laws, Justice & Governance:</strong><br>
            Dwapar saw the use of:<br>
            Smritis (Manu Smriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti)<br>
            Village councils (sabhas) and royal courts<br>
            Justice based on Shastra, customs, and king’s judgment<br>
            But:<br>
            Justice was not always equal<br>
            Innocent people were punished (e.g. Pandavas’ exile)<br>
            The influence of power and manipulation often distorted fairness</p>

        <p><strong>🕉️ Religion and Temples</strong><br>
            Temples became more ornate than in Treta. Worship was:<br>
            Ritual-heavy, with daily offerings, yajnas, and donations<br>
            Focused on Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, Surya<br>
            Personal devotion (bhakti) to Krishna grew massively<br>
            Important Practices:<br>
            Sandhya Vandana<br>
            Puja with mantra and offerings<br>
            Festivals like Janmashtami, Ekadashi, Holi began to take form</p>

        <p><strong>🗣️ Language, Literature & Learning:</strong><br>
            Sanskrit remained the language of scholars and scriptures<br>
            Rise of epics (Mahabharata) and Itihasa-Puranas<br>
            Great scholars like Ved Vyasa, Narada, Gargacharya<br>
            Children were educated in Gurukuls — forest academies under sages. They learned:<br>
            Vedas<br>
            Astronomy<br>
            Logic (Nyaya)<br>
            Ethics and Dharma<br>
            Martial arts<br>
            But over time, learning became restricted to higher castes.</p>

        <p><strong>🎨 Culture, Arts & Music:</strong><br>
            Dwapar was a golden age of the arts:<br>
            Dance and music in palaces and temples<br>
            Veena, Mridangam, Flute used widely<br>
            Krishna’s flute playing enchanted all beings<br>
            Painting, sculpture, and city design flourished in Dwarka and Indraprastha<br>
            Culture was rich, but the soul of it began to wane as spiritual depth declined.</p>

        <p><strong>🛡️ Military and Weapons:</strong><br>
            Dwapar Yuga saw the rise of divine weapons (astras) and organized warfare.<br>
            Weapons used:<br>
            Bows like Gandiva (Arjuna) and Sharanga (Krishna)<br>
            Divine missiles like Brahmastra, Agneyastra, Pashupatastra<br>
            Maces (Gada), swords, chakras, spears<br>
            Battle formations like Chakravyuha, Garuda Vyuha were developed.</p>

        <p><strong>💔 Signs of Decay in Culture:</strong><br>
            Despite glory, signs of decline were evident:<br>
            Temples flourished, but inner devotion weakened<br>
            Debates increased, but realization decreased<br>
            Arts became for pride, not for transcendence<br>
            Varnas hardened, blocking spiritual upliftment of masses<br>
            These show that external culture advanced, but internal culture declined.</p>

            <h3>🕍️ Introduction to Divine Incarnations:</h3>

        <h2>📖 Chapter 8: Spiritual Paths and Yogas in Dwapar Yuga</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>🕉️ Introduction – Spiritual Crisis and Divine Guidance:</h3>
        <p>In Dwapar Yuga, the path to liberation became more complex. Unlike Satya or Treta Yuga, where Dharma was
            natural or king-led, Dwapar required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual effort</li>
            <li>Scriptural study</li>
            <li>Inner transformation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This age introduced three major paths to Moksha:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Karma Yoga – The path of right action</li>
            <li>Bhakti Yoga – The path of devotion</li>
            <li>Jnana Yoga – The path of wisdom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Gita describes Dwapar as the age where “Yogah karmasu kaushalam” – Yoga lies in skillful action.</p>

        <h3>⚙️ Karma Yoga – Dharma through Duty:</h3>
        <h3>🔹 Definition:</h3>
        <p>Karma Yoga is the yoga of selfless action, where a person:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fulfills their duty (Svadharma)</li>
            <li>Offers all actions to the divine</li>
            <li>Acts without attachment to the result</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>📟 Gita’s Teachings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>“You have the right to action, but not the fruits thereof.” – Gita 2.47</li>
            <li>“Do your duty; leave the results to me.” – Gita 18.66</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🧠 How It Was Practiced:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Warriors like Arjuna, Bhishma practiced Karma Yoga through battle</li>
            <li>Kings like Yudhishthira ruled with Dharma as their karma</li>
            <li>Even servants like Vidura followed it in palace politics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Karma Yoga taught: Action done for Dharma is worship.</p>

        <h3>❤️ Bhakti Yoga – Love for the Divine:</h3>
        <h3>🔹 Definition:</h3>
        <p>Bhakti Yoga is the path of loving surrender to God – no rituals, no caste barriers.</p>
        <h3>👑 Krishna’s Role:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Krishna’s leelas taught people that God is personal, lovable, and playful.</li>
            <li>Gopis and Radha followed pure Bhakti Yoga</li>
            <li>Arjuna practiced Sakhya Bhakti (friendship with God)</li>
            <li>Draupadi’s single cry “Hey Govinda!” moved the universe</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🔥 Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Naam Japa (chanting divine name)</li>
            <li>Seva (service to God and beings)</li>
            <li>Viraha (divine separation and longing)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bhakti in Dwapar was emotional, powerful, and beyond logic.</p>

        <h3>🧠 Jnana Yoga – Realization through Knowledge</h3>
        <h3>🔹 Definition:</h3>
        <p>Jnana Yoga is the path of intellectual discrimination, where truth is found through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Study of scriptures</li>
            <li>Logic and inquiry</li>
            <li>Detachment from Maya</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🙊 Practiced by:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ved Vyasa through division of knowledge</li>
            <li>Bhishma on his bed of arrows</li>
            <li>Rishis like Narada, Asita, Devala who roamed teaching truth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gita says: “Among all yogis, the Jnani is dearest to Me.” – Gita 7.17</p>
        <p>But Dwapar warned: Jnana without Bhakti leads to pride.</p>

        <h3>📟 Sankhya & Vedanta in Dwapar:</h3>
        <p><strong>Sankhya:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Propounded by Kapila Muni</li>
            <li>Divides world into Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (matter)</li>
            <li>Popular among sages like Dattatreya, Asita, and Rishi Shuka</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Vedanta:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Taught by Vyasa in the Brahma Sutras</li>
            <li>Merged Jnana with Bhakti, paving the way for future saints like Shankaracharya</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🛤️ Temples and Spiritual Centers:</h3>
        <p>Temples became centers of inner awakening and not just ritual:</p>

        <h3>Paths of Renunciation and Householding:</h3>
        <p>Unlike previous Yugas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saints lived in forests and cities</li>
            <li>Kings like Yudhishthira became sages in the end</li>
            <li>Arjuna died in Himalayas after detachment</li>

        <h3>🔱 Philosophy of Dharma in Dwapar:</h3>
        <p>Dharma in Dwapar Yuga was confusing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dharma vs Adharma blurred (e.g., Krishna using strategy)</li>
            <li>Conflicts arose between personal duty and cosmic order</li>
            <li>Situational Dharma (Yuga Dharma) became dominant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gita introduced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Svadharma</strong> = Personal duty</li>
            <li><strong>Loka Sangraha</strong> = Upliftment of society</li>
            <li><strong>Nishkama Karma</strong> = Duty without desire</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This complex Dharma made people choose consciously, not blindly.</p>

        <p>From flute of Krishna to bow of Arjuna, every symbol in Dwapar taught:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "True spirituality is to do your role with love, awareness, and surrender."
