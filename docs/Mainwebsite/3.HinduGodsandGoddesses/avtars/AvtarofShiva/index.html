        <h1>Avatars of Lord Shiva</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Veerabhadra – The Wrathful Destroyer</h2>
            <p>Veerabhadra was created from a lock of Shiva’s hair when Sati immolated herself at her father Daksha’s
                yagna. Overcome with grief and fury, Shiva tore out a lock of his matted hair and hurled it to the
                ground. From it arose Veerabhadra — a fearsome, dark being wielding countless weapons and surrounded by
                a host of spirits. Veerabhadra stormed Daksha’s sacrifice, destroyed everything, and beheaded Daksha.
                Only after intense prayers did Shiva revive Daksha with a goat’s head.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Divine wrath, justice, destruction of ego<br>
                <strong>📚 Scripture:</strong> Skanda Purana, Shiva Purana
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Bhairava – The Terrifying One</h2>
            <p>Bhairava is one of the most powerful and fearsome forms of Shiva, often seen in fierce tantric
                traditions. According to legend, Brahma once grew arrogant. Bhairava emerged and cut off one of Brahma’s
                heads, earning the curse of carrying the skull until his sin was expiated. Bhairava roamed as Kapali,
                the skull-bearer, until his sin was washed away in Varanasi.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Ego destruction, time, ultimate justice<br>
                <strong>📚 Worshipped in:</strong> Kalabhairava temples in Ujjain, Varanasi
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Nataraja – The Cosmic Dancer</h2>
            <p>As Nataraja, Shiva performs the Tandava, the dance of creation, preservation, and destruction. With one
                foot on the demon of ignorance (Apasmara), and surrounded by a ring of fire, Nataraja’s dance is both
                terrifying and beautiful.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Cosmic order, art, transcendence<br>
                <strong>📚 Iconography:</strong> Shiva with four arms, surrounded by fire
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Ardhanarishvara – The Half-Woman Form</h2>
            <p>Shiva merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara — half male, half female — showing that masculine and
                feminine are two aspects of the same truth. It represents balance, unity, and the sacredness of both
                energies.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Gender unity, divine wholeness<br>
                <strong>📚 Scriptures:</strong> Linga Purana, Skanda Purana
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Pashupatinath – Lord of Beings</h2>
            <p>As Pashupatinath, Shiva is the protector and lord of all living creatures, especially animals. This
                compassionate form is revered in Nepal and represents Shiva as a divine herder and healer.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Compassion, nature, protector of souls<br>
                <strong>🛕 Famous Temple:</strong> Pashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Mahakala – The Lord of Time</h2>
            <p>Mahakala is Shiva in his most supreme form, where even time (Kala) is under his control. He is the
                destroyer of time and death, and his worship is central to many tantric sects. Mahakala swallows the
                universe at the end of creation.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Timelessness, power beyond death<br>
                <strong>📚 Worshipped in:</strong> Ujjain Mahakaleshwar Temple
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Rudra – The Roaring Storm</h2>
            <p>Rudra is the Vedic form of Shiva, described as fierce, wild, and unpredictable. Associated with storms,
                Rudra roams the wilderness and brings both destruction and healing. He is a precursor to later forms of
                Shiva.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Primal energy, untamed force of nature<br>
                <strong>📚 Scriptures:</strong> Rig Veda
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Ashutosh – The Easily Pleased</h2>
            <p>Shiva is called Ashutosh because he is easily pleased by devotion, regardless of status, purity, or sin.
                Many stories, like those of Bhasmasura, Ravana, and Ganesha’s birth, highlight his instant grace.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Grace, accessibility, simplicity<br>
                <strong>📚 Beloved by:</strong> Saints, sages, and even demons
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Dakshinamurti – The Divine Teacher</h2>
            <p>In this peaceful form, Shiva is the Adi Guru, seated under a banyan tree, teaching silent wisdom to
                sages. He imparts knowledge of yoga, music, and supreme reality.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Guru, inner wisdom, silence<br>
                <strong>📚 Iconography:</strong> Shiva facing south, seated with chinmudra
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Kama Bhasma – The Destroyer of Desire</h2>
            <p>When Kamadeva tried to awaken Shiva’s love for Parvati, Shiva opened his third eye and reduced Kama to
                ashes. This form symbolizes the destruction of lust and desire as obstacles to spiritual progress.</p>
            <p><strong>🕉️ Symbolism:</strong> Self-control, renunciation, inner power<br>
                <strong>📚 Scriptures:</strong> Shiva Purana
